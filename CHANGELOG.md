## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-16

First public release.

### Added

- `clocwork [REPO]`: analyses a git repository's whole history into a
  dashboard in a sibling workspace (`<repo>-stats`).
  - Every commit is measured with `cloc --git --diff`, cached per file, and
    reconciled against a `cloc` snapshot of HEAD.
  - `cloc` runs once per CPU core by default (`--jobs`), and
    `--max-commits` spreads a long history over several runs.
  - `cloc` 2.06 or later is required. An older one is refused, because it
    lists file extensions in a form clocwork misreads.
- Lines per language and per type (code, comment, blank) at every commit,
  and the test-code share at HEAD.
  - Built-in test-path rules cover common ecosystems.
  - `clocwork.toml` can add to the rules, exclude from them or replace them.
- AI-assisted commits, read from `Co-Authored-By` trailers, with the date
  each model first appeared.
  - Any Claude model is recognised, as are Copilot, Cursor, Codex, Devin,
    aider, Gemini and Gemini Code Assist.
  - `[agents].extra` names anything else.
- Token usage from Claude Code, Codex CLI and Gemini CLI logs.
  - It is archived per day, agent and model in `token_usage.json`, which no
    run shrinks.
  - Days without logs are estimated from each agent's own tokens-per-line
    ratio.
  - Usage is priced at API list prices, and its electricity is estimated.
  - `clocwork tokens` archives without analysing, for use from cron.
- `clocwork render` re-renders an existing workspace.
- `clocwork.json` is a workspace identity guard: a run against a different
  repository is refused.
- Every number, date and unit on the page is formatted for a region locale.
- A `clocwork(1)` manual page.
